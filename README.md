# Spam-Email-Detection

This project implements a spam email detection model using the Naive Bayes algorithm, focusing on classifying emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). The model utilizes the following components and techniques:

Components:

Dataset:
The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled emails, where each email is categorized as spam or ham.

Text Processing:
Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorization using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn are applied to convert email text into numerical feature vectors.

Naive Bayes Classifier:
The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is employed due to its effectiveness with text data and ability to handle multiple features.

Pipeline:
A Pipeline from scikit-learn is used to streamline the workflow, integrating text vectorization and model training into a single process.

Techniques Used:
Feature Engineering: Experimentation with different text features such as n-grams and TF-IDF to enhance model performance.

Model Evaluation: Cross-validation techniques are utilized to evaluate and optimize the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search or randomized search is employed to find optimal hyperparameters for the Naive Bayes classifier.

Usage:

To use this project:

Install Dependencies: Ensure all required Python libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.) are installed.

Dataset: Prepare a dataset of labeled emails (spam and ham) for training and testing.

Training: Train the model using the provided dataset and evaluate its performance using suitable evaluation metrics.

Testing: Test the model on new email data to predict whether each email is spam or not.

Future Improvements:
Implementing advanced techniques like ensemble methods or deep learning models to further improve classification accuracy.

Exploring additional features or metadata associated with emails to enhance model robustness.
